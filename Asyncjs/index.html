  <b>1.<u>  What is Synchronous Programming?</b></u> <br />
  Synchronous programming is a way for computers to do things one step at a
  time, in the order they are given the instructions.
</p>

  <b>2. <u>ðŸ§  What is Asynchronous Programming?</u></b>
JavaScript runs one thing at a time (single-threaded). But some tasksâ€”like fetching data from the internet, reading files, or waiting for user inputâ€”take time.

If JS waited for these tasks to finish, it would freeze the entire app.

ðŸ‘‰ So we use asynchronous programming to let these tasks run in the background, while the rest of our code keeps going.

<b>
  ðŸ’¡ Best Practice:
Use callbacks only for small things.
Use Promises or async/await for real-world asynchronous tasks (APIs, files, DB, etc.).
